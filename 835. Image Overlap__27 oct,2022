835. Image Overlap

You are given two images, img1 and img2, represented as binary, square matrices of size n x n. A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.

We translate one image however we choose by sliding all the 1 bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. We then place it on top of the other image. We can then calculate the overlap by counting the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.

Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation. Any 1 bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.

Return the largest possible overlap.

 

Example 1:


Input: img1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]], img2 = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We translate img1 to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.

The number of positions that have a 1 in both images is 3 (shown in red).

Example 2:

Input: img1 = [[1]], img2 = [[1]]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: img1 = [[0]], img2 = [[0]]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

n == img1.length == img1[i].length
n == img2.length == img2[i].length
1 <= n <= 30
img1[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
img2[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

ANSWER: -

class Solution {
public:
    int largestOverlap(vector<vector<int>>& img1, vector<vector<int>>& img2) {
        int n=img1.size();
        
        vector<pair<int,int>> first1s;
        vector<pair<int,int>> second1s;
        
        // pushing the location of 1s in both images
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
            {
                if(img1[i][j]==1)
                    first1s.push_back({i,j});
                if(img2[i][j]==1)
                    second1s.push_back({i,j});
            }
        }
        
        int ans=0;
        map<pair<int,int>,int> mp;
        
        for(auto [i1,j1]:first1s)
        {
            for(auto [i2,j2]:second1s)
            {
                mp[{i2-i1,j2-j1}]++;
                ans=max(ans,mp[{i2-i1,j2-j1}]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
