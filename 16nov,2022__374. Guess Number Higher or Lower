374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
Easy

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
1 <= pick <= n

// Binary Search Approach

/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low=1;
        int high=n;
        
        while(low<= high)
        {
            int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
            int res=guess(mid);
            
            if(res==0)
                return mid;
            else if(res<0)
                high=mid-1;
            else
                low=mid+1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};

// more optimized
// ternary search Approach

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid1 = low + (high - low) / 3;
            int mid2 = high - (high - low) / 3;
            int res1 = guess(mid1);
            int res2 = guess(mid2);
            if (res1 == 0)
                return mid1;
            if (res2 == 0)
                return mid2;
            else if (res1 < 0)
                high = mid1 - 1;
            else if (res2 > 0)
                low = mid2 + 1;
            else {
                low = mid1 + 1;
                high = mid2 - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
